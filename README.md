# Product Roadmap

This roadmap contains all improvements and new features we plan for our APIs.

Check the [Kanban board in this project](https://github.com/api-sports/public-roadmap/projects/1) for an overview.

Note: This roadmap is only the improvements and new features and not the bugs, for the most part we manage them directly as we see them or as they are reported by our users. To report a bug, you can do it directly from the chat on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.api-football.com)

## Suggest a new feature

Tell us what feature. Just go [here and create an issue](https://github.com/api-sports/public-roadmap/issues) in this project and label it as "Feature" and select the label corresponding to the API "Football, Basketball etc...". 

Please explain your idea clearly and legibly and also check that it has not already been submitted by another user, in this case your request will be labeled "Duplicate".
